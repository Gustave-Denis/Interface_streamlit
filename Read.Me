This is my first attempt at using streamlit and creating a basic interface page which will ask for name, surname and email address.

Update: I have now written code which generates a yaml file containing all inputs from a streamlit form which I coded.

Currently working on adding a 'variable d'environnement' to my code which will enable it to automatically send off my yaml file to a desired email address.
