This is my first attempt at using streamlit and creating a basic interface page which will ask for name, surname and email address along with other required inputs.

Update: I have now written code which generates a yaml file containing all inputs from a streamlit form which I coded.

Update: I have now coded a second python file which directly sends the yaml file to a desired email address once the user presses the submit button on the streamlit form. This python file uses environment variables to access sensitive information such as email accounts and passwords.
