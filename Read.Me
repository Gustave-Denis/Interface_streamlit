This is my first attempt at using streamlit and creating a basic interface page which will ask for name, surname and email address.

content_string = input(surname and name and email and user_input and user_input2 and group and option1 and option2)
        content_string = content_string.split()
        print("\n")
     for attribute in content_string:
            print(attribute)

    st.download_button("download form contents", attribute, "Heuritech.form")
